  <h1>Strengths:</h1>
  <hr>
	<p>
	I have been told by many people that I'm an old soul. This may meen to some people that I'm boring, and to others that I'm kind. I have found that I'm a very minimilistic person and that I don't want for much. However, when I want something, I am relentless in the persuit of it. Whatever it may be from troubleshooting my computer and trying to find the problem, to improving my performance at anything that I deem neccesarry. Through my years of employement. I have found that I have a very strong work ethic. I'm willing to do what it takes to get the job done.</p>
  <h1>Accomplishments:</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
 	There are only a few things in my life that I feel should be put under an accomplishments tab of a Resume. One of which is graduating from Highschool, which is something of a requirement for most people so I'm having trouble putting it down here, but I will anyway. One thing that I've accomplished that I feel will push me forward and help me to become self motivated is my recent weight loss. I started at 260 pounds close to two years ago now, and am down to 180 pounds. This was the single hardest thing that I have ever attempted and succeeded in, and also the thing in my life I am most proud of. I intend to use the same perseverence and willpower to drive my life to a better place.</p>
  <h1>Interests:</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>	I've recently started enjoying hiking and seeing the country a lot more. I hiked up Mt. Massive in Colorado with my dad, and we have started planning a 10 day hike in Switzerland next year. I've always been a computer nerd. Video-games were my first love and I'll always have a soft spot for them.</p>
